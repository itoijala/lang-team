<p>Welcome to the repository for the Rust Language Design Team.  This
page stores our administrative information, meeting minutes, as well
as some amount of design constraints. It's also still a
work-in-progress (insert omnipresent mid 90s logo for under
construction here).</p>
<h1 id="chat-platform"><a class="header" href="#chat-platform">Chat platform</a></h1>
<p>The lang team hangs out in the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/chat/zulip.html">rust-lang Zulip</a> in the <code>#t-lang</code>
stream. There are also other <code>#t-lang/*</code> streams that might be of
interest.</p>
<h1 id="calendar"><a class="header" href="#calendar">Calendar</a></h1>
<p>We have a lang-team calendar that shows the time for our various meetings.
Meetings are generally open to anyone who wants to listen in. We also try to
post <a href="./minutes.html">minutes and recordings</a> on a &quot;best-effort&quot; basis from our
meetings.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=recud4b9o8cmc0m5rmr033p5nk%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York">View calendar</a> -- use this to view the calendar online and add it to your Google Calendar</li>

<h1 id="meetings"><a class="header" href="#meetings">Meetings</a></h1>
<p>The lang team has two standing meetings. The current timing for these
can be found on the <a href="./calendar.html">lang team calendar</a>. We
generally record our public meetings and post the recordings in our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85XCvVPmGQg-gYy7R6a_Y91oQLdsbSpa">YouTube playlist</a> (along with automatically created subtitles). We
also publish notes and minutes in written form in this github
repository.</p>
<h2 id="triage-meeting"><a class="header" href="#triage-meeting">Triage meeting</a></h2>
<p>The weekly triage meeting is when we go over the newly filed project
proposals along with issues that have been nominated for lang-team
feedback. We also get regular updates from the active project groups
so we can stay on top of what is going on.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/tree/master/minutes">Triage meeting minutes are available in this directory.</a></p>
<h3 id="nominating-an-issue-pr-rfc-etc-for-the-triage-meeting"><a class="header" href="#nominating-an-issue-pr-rfc-etc-for-the-triage-meeting">Nominating an issue, PR, RFC etc for the triage meeting</a></h3>
<p>You can nominate an issue/PR/RFC etc for the triage meeting by adding
the <code>T-lang</code> and <code>I-nominated</code> labels. When you do so, it's best if
you leave a comment explaining what kind of feedback you would
like. We try to go over all nominated issues and leave a comment
of some kind in response.</p>
<h2 id="design-meeting"><a class="header" href="#design-meeting">Design meeting</a></h2>
<p>The second weekly meeting is our <strong>design meeting</strong>. The design
meeting topics are used for in-depth discussions on a particular
topic, often in connection with an active working group.</p>
<h3 id="proposing-a-topic-for-a-design-meeting"><a class="header" href="#proposing-a-topic-for-a-design-meeting">Proposing a topic for a design meeting</a></h3>
<p>You can propose a topic for a design meeting by opening an <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/new/choose">Design
meeting proposal</a> issue on the lang-team repository. During our weekly
triage meetings, we scan open issues to try and decide whether to
schedule meetings in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<h1 id="priorities"><a class="header" href="#priorities">Priorities</a></h1>
<p>This page describes the current lang team priorities and explains
their motivations. This page is typically updated as part of the
yearly Rust roadmap process. They are derived from a combination of
the Rust survey results, feedback from users, and other soruces. When
new project proposals are created, they can cite priorities listed in
this page.</p>
<p>Each priority also lists lang-team members who typically prefer to
liaison for issues in this area. This can give you an idea of who you
might reach out to if you wish to discuss a project proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2020-07-28</p>
<ul>
<li>Async I/O
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Continued improvements with ergonomics and productivity related to Async I/O.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Shows up heavily on the survey, this is an obvious area where a lot of Rust developers are working.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/withoutboats">withoutboats</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cramertj">cramertj</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C Parity, interop, and embedded -- these often overlap in 'low level capabilities'
<ul>
<li><strong>What</strong>? Extending Rust's low-level capabilities to do &quot;things otherwise only possible in C or assembly&quot;, as well as enabling smooth, ergonomic FFI between other languages and Rust.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Embedded is a large factor in the survey.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Our ability to act like &quot;native C&quot; is a differentiating capability for Rust. We've seen a lot of traction integrating into big companies on this basis, as a C++ replacement. It's clear that doing this requires the ability to do piecewise adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/joshtriplett">joshtriplett</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Const generics and constant evaluation
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Supporting </li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Heavily requested feature and important for key areas.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/withoutboats">withoutboats</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trait and type system extensions
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Specifically impl Trait, GATs, and specialization</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Long-standing areas that affect a lot of domains, including async</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Error handling
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Combination of <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/#conclusion">library related improvements</a> that consolidate &quot;best practices&quot; into standard library, documentation to describe how it works, as well as possible language improvements to leverage those changes (try blocks, <code>yeet</code>/<code>throw</code> keyword, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Cross-cutting productivity concern, and a persistent problem that makes working with Rust code more difficult than it should be.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Anecdotally, something that comes up for a lot of people (see e.g. <a href="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/rust-in-2020-one-more-thing/">nrc's #rust2020 blog post</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/withoutboats">withoutboats</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joshtriplett">joshtriplett</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Borrow checker expressiveness and other lifetime issues
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Think Polonius, RFC 2229, RFC 66, and other ideas like knowing which fields of <code>self</code> are used by particular methods.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Learning curve remains a stubborn problem, and the best way to improve it is to make the compiler smarter.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix">pnkfelix</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unsafe code capabilities and reference material
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Document the rules for legal unsafe code and add features that either add required capabilities or make correct code easier and more ergonomic to write.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Growing base of unsafe code, changes here are getting harder, this represents a kind of &quot;reputation risk&quot;. We really want to be &quot;better than C&quot; here.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis">nikomatsakis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix">pnkfelix</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Targeted ergonomic wins and extensions
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> Small additions or improvements to make Rust easier to use.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> These will never rise to the &quot;top of the list&quot;, but they often have outsized impact on people's enjoyment of Rust.</li>
<li><strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/scottmcm">scottmcm</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Soundness holes to try and correct
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Rust's appeal rests on safety. We have to make steady progress on these points. It's often hard to prioritize them compared to &quot;whiz-bang&quot; features. Also, long-running safety issues can cause fallout when fixed, weakening our stability guarantees.</li>

<p>Would you like to find out what the lang team is working on? Check out
our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/projects/2">github project board</a>. It shows the active projects at each stage
of development, along with an explanation of the various stages. Each
project has a representative issue that links to more complete
information. The stages of a project are as follows: </p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Proposal</td><td>Deciding whether to start this project</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exploration</td><td>Exploring the problem space and deciding what RFC(s) to write</td></tr>
<tr><td>RFC</td><td>There is a pending RFC describing the design</td></tr>
<tr><td>Implementing</td><td>There is an accepted RFC, but implementation work is ongoing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>The RFC is fully implemented and we are requesting public feedback</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stabilized</td><td>The feature is complete and available on stable compilers</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If you'd like to read more about the stages of a project, or you would
like to propose a new project, see the <a href="./proposing_a_project.html">&quot;proposing a new
project&quot;</a> page.</p>
<h1 id="proposing-a-new-project"><a class="header" href="#proposing-a-new-project">Proposing a new project</a></h1>
<p>Interested in extending the Rust language in some way? The language
design team is experimenting with a new staged process.</p>
<h2 id="first-step-file-a-project-proposal"><a class="header" href="#first-step-file-a-project-proposal">First step: file a Project Proposal</a></h2>
<p>The very first step is [file a <strong>project proposal</strong> issue]. A project
proposal is a lightweight issue that describes your motivations, any
ideas you've had thus far on the design, and other background
information.</p>
<p><strong>The primary role of the proposal is to request feedback on an idea
from the lang team.</strong> Before creating a proposal, it's a good idea to
create a thread on internals and float the idea to get immediate
feedback on whether the problem is real, prior ideas, or related
problems. However, you don't have to have a complete solution in mind
-- and it's fine to have 2 or 3 ideas for how one might solve
something.</p>
<p>Once you file the issue, a Zulip stream will be created and you may
start to get feedback right away. The proposal will also be discussed
in the <a href="./meetings.html#triage-meeting">triage meeting</a>, and we'll try to post general feedback from
that meeting.</p>
<p>The next step depends on the scope of the proposal and on whether a
[lang-team liaison] is available who has bandwidth.</p>
<h3 id="smaller-proposals-that-can-be-implemented-directly"><a class="header" href="#smaller-proposals-that-can-be-implemented-directly">Smaller proposals that can be implemented directly</a></h3>
<p>If a proposal is considered &quot;small&quot;, then the lang-team will approve
the proposal to go straight to PR. In this case, the next step is
simply to create an implementation on the appropriate rust-lang
repository. The PR can cite the proposal page in its description.</p>
<p>Proposals approved to go straight to PR are tagged as
<code>implementation-needed</code>.</p>
<h3 id="larger-proposals-that-require-an-rfc"><a class="header" href="#larger-proposals-that-require-an-rfc">Larger proposals that require an RFC</a></h3>
<p>Most proposals however require some sort of RFC to be implemented. In
this case, we will create a <strong>project group</strong> to pursue the project.
A project group is just a group of people who are authoring the RFC
and pushing it through to stabilization (and ideally through
implementation as well, although sometimes that involves very
difficult people).</p>
<p>If we decide that a proposal requires an RFC, then once it is assigned
a liaison, it will be tagged with <code>charter-needed</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Propose a charter:</strong> The liaison will work with the author of the
proposal (and any other interested parties) to create a project
charter, based on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/tree/master/minutes">charter template</a>. This is often just a copy
of the MCP, updated with whatever new material came up during
discussion. The charter should be added to the lang-team repository
in a PR, and that PR can &quot;close&quot; the proposal issue.
<ul>
<li>This charter PR is approved by the lang-team with a <code>@rustbot fcp merge</code> command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exploration phase:</strong> Once the project is created, it enters the &quot;exploration
phase&quot;. We will create a Zulip stream, project issue, and potentially a repository
as desired. The goal of this phase is to explore the design space and to come up
with one or more RFCs that will actually solve the problem. The project
should keep the lang team up to date on the designs being considered during
this phase.
<ul>
<li>It is also permitted to land feature-gated code in the rust
compiler during this phase, although any such change should be
considered highly unstable (and should ideally be minimally
disruptive).</li>
<li>Project groups are also encouraged to write regular blog posts in the 
Inside Rust blog documenting their progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RFC phase:</strong> The output of the exploration phase is one or more
RFCs that describes the proposed design; these RFCs are typically
written by the project group collaboratively. It's a good idea to
create RFCs early because this they often receive much wider
community feedback and may uncover problems in the design.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation phase:</strong> Once the RFC is landed, implementation typically
begins, although it sometimes happens that implementation occurs concurrently
with authoring the RFC.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation phase:</strong> Once implementation of the RFC is complete, the project
group should write a blog post requesting evaluation. They should keep the
lang-team abreast of any feedback that is received.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilization phase:</strong> Finally, the feature can be stabilized and released
on stable Rust. This is done by authorizing a stabilization report, as
<a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html">described here</a>.</li>

<p>In some cases, there is a liaison who really likes the idea of a
proposal, but does not presently have the bandwidth to pursue the
idea. In that case, it can be assigned to the liaison but tagged as
<code>shortlisted</code>. The liaison should comment on when they expect to have
bandwidth to help out; if other liaisons are available, they may want
to pick up the project instead.</p>

<p>The lang-team liaison has the job of monitoring the progress on the
project and posting updates for the rest of the team. These updates
can be delivered in person at the <a href="./meetings.html#triage-meeting">triage meeting</a> or as comments on
the corresponding tracking issue for the project.</p>
<p>Liaisons should particularly focus on questions where the lang team
can help -- for example, if the project has narrowed down the set of
options to a few viable candidates, it would be good to seek lang team
feedback on which option seems the most promising (often this would be
a good point to request a <a href="./meetings.html#design-meeting">design meeting</a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes liaisons will also get actively involved in the design itself,
or help to mediate the exploration of the design space and ensure
that the project is pursuing all the possible designs.</p>

<p>When evaluating project proposals, the lang-team is looking to figure
out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does this proposal solve a problem?</strong> Does that problem fit within our
stated priorities?</li>
<li><strong>Who are the people involved in this proposal?</strong> In particular, are
there stakeholders who have explored this design but are not
mentioned in the proposal?</li>
<li><strong>What is the scope of work involved and is it proportional to the
problem being solved?</strong> Sometimes there are problems that are really
complex to solve and ultimately not that important.</li>
<li><strong>How &quot;contained&quot; is this project?</strong> Sometimes, even narrow-sounding
features can wind up affecting lots of things in the language and
requiring lots of team bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>How controversial is this project and is it proportional to the
problem being solved?</strong> Let's be honest. Lang team discussions can
sometimes get quite heated. Sometimes we might decide that even if
we think an idea is good, it's not worth the controversy that will
result from pursuing it.</li>
<li><strong>Do we have the right people involved?</strong> Some ideas require
specific stakeholders to be a success. This might be because of
specific knowledge (e.g., deep understanding of the type system), or
because we want representatives for specific use cases, or because
we want representatives from a wider variety of
companies/backgrounds. If there have been big projects in this area,
we might want representatives from all those projects.</li>
<li><strong>What other things are going on?</strong> We are trying hard not to take
on more work than we can handle. It's very tempting in open source
to start a ton of different activities because there are often lots
of people around with good ideas, but having too many things going
on is very stressful for everyone.</li>

<p>This section contains &quot;notes&quot; about the design of various proposals.

<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>In rust today, an integer like <code>1</code> cannot be inferred to floating
point type. This means that valid-looking numeric expressions like
<code>22.5 + 1</code> will not compile, and one must instead write <code>22.5 + 1.0</code>. Can/should we change this?</p>
<h2 id="history"><a class="header" href="#history">History</a></h2>
<p>This was discussed on Zulip in <a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html">May 2020</a>. Some of the key highlights from the discussion were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating point literals are prone to many surprises that integers
are not. For <a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html#196887384">example</a>, <code>20_000_000 + 1</code>, if inferred to <code>f32</code>
type, would have the final value <code>20_000_000.0</code>. This leads some to
conclude that <a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html#196887384">&quot;the surprise factor of floats is so high that they
are qualitatively different than integers&quot;</a>.</li>
<li>But there are a lot of similar surprising things:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html#196930252"><code>20_000_001_f32</code>, for example, is also going to be <code>20_000_000</code>.</a></li>
<li>Integer overflow can mean that <code>255 + 1</code> has the value 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some key questions to consider:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/213817tlang/43153EditionRequestlet1beafloatliteral.html#196926142">How often does adding <code>.0</code> result in some insight?</a></li>
<li>How much would <em>seeing</em> the <code>.0</code> help to debug a tricky problem?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balanced against the annoyance and surprise factor.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="generalized-coroutines"><a class="header" href="#generalized-coroutines">Generalized coroutines</a></h1>
<p>Since even before Rust 1.0, users have desired the ability to <code>yield</code> like in
other languages. The compiler infrastructure to achieve this, along with an
unstable syntax, have existed for a while now. But despite <em>a lot</em> of debate,
we've failed to polish the feature up enough to stabilize it. I've tried to
write up a summary of the different design considerations and the past debate
around them below:</p>
<h2 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The distinction between a &quot;coroutine&quot; and a &quot;generator&quot; can be a bit vague,
varying from one discussion to the next.</li>
<li>In these notes a generator is anything which <em>directly</em> implements <code>Iterator</code>
or <code>Stream</code> while a coroutine is anything which can take arbitrary input,
yield arbitrary output, and later resume execution at the previous yield.</li>
<li>Thus, the &quot;generator&quot; syntax proposed in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a> and currently
implemented behind the &quot;generator&quot; feature is actually a coroutine syntax for
the sake of these notes, <em>not a true generator</em>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2996/">RFC-2996</a> defines a true generator syntax in &quot;future additions&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note also that &quot;coroutines&quot; here are really &quot;semicoroutines&quot; since they can
only yield back to their caller.</li>
<li>I will continue to group the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">original eRFC text</a> and the later <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68524">generator
resume arguments</a> extension
togther as &quot;<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a>&quot;. That way I only have 3 big proposals to deal
with.</li>
<li>In rustc, a coroutine's &quot;witness&quot; is the space where stack-allocated values
are stored if needed across yields. I'm borrowing this terminology here. Any
such cross-yield bindings are said to be &quot;witnessed&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// This is an example coroutine which might assist a streaming base64 encoder
|sextet, octets| {
    let a = sextet; // witness a, b, and c sextets for later use
    yield;
    let b = sextet;
    octets.push(a &lt;&lt; 2 | b &gt;&gt; 4); // aaaaaabb
    yield;
    let c = sextet;
    octets.push((b &amp; 0b1111) &lt;&lt; 4 | c &gt;&gt; 2); // bbbbcccc
    yield;
    octets.push((c &amp; 0b11) &lt;&lt; 6 | sextet) // ccdddddd
}

// This is an example generator which might be used in Iterator::flat_map.
gen {
  for item in inner {
    for mapped in func(item) {
      yield mapped;
    }
  }
}

// This is an example async generator which might be used in Stream::and_then
async gen {
  while let Some(item) = inner.next().await {
    yield func(item).await;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="coroutine-trait"><a class="header" href="#coroutine-trait">Coroutine trait</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The coroutine syntax must produce implementations of some trait.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2781">RFC-2781</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a> propose the <code>Generator</code> trait.</li>
<li>Note that Rust's coroutines and subroutines look the same from the outside:
take input, mutate state, produce output.</li>
<li>Thus, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a> proposes using the <code>Fn*</code> traits instead, including a new
<code>FnPin</code> for immovable coroutines.
<ul>
<li>Hierarchy: <code>Fn</code> is <code>FnMut + Unpin</code> is <code>FnPin</code> is <code>FnOnce</code>.
<ul>
<li>May not be <em>required</em> at the trait level (someone may someday find a use
to implementing <code>FnMut + !FnPin</code>) but all closures implement the traits in
this order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coroutine-syntax"><a class="header" href="#coroutine-syntax">Coroutine syntax</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The closure syntax is reused for coroutines by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2781">RFC-2781</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a>.</li>
<li>Commentators have suggested that the differences between coroutines and
closures under <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2781">RFC-2781</a> justify an entirely distinct
syntax to reduce confusion.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a> fully reuses the <em>semantics</em> of closures, greatly simplifying the
design space and making the shared syntax obvious.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="taking-input"><a class="header" href="#taking-input">Taking input</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The major disagreement between past proposals is whether to use &quot;yield
expressions&quot; or &quot;magic mutation&quot;.
<ul>
<li>Yield expression: <code>let after = yield output;</code>
<ul>
<li>Used by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Magic mutation: <code>let before = arg; yield output; let after = arg;</code>
<ul>
<li>Used by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2781">RFC-2781</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many people have a strong gut preference for yield expressions.
<ul>
<li>In simple cases, Rust generally prefers to produce values as output from
expressions rather than by mutation of state. &quot;Yield expressions <em>feel</em> more
Rusty.&quot;</li>
<li>However, magic mutation is likely correct, even though at first glance it
feels surprising. In addition to reasons below, holding references to past
resume args is rare, often a logic error. Rust can use mutation checks to
catch and give feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Magic mutation&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. The resume argument values are <em>not
themselves being mutated.</em> The argument bindings are simply being reassigned
across yields.
<ul>
<li>In a sense, argument bindings are reassigned in the exact same way across
returns.</li>
<li>Previous arguments (if unmoved) are dropped prior to yielding and are
reassigned after resuming.</li>
<li>People will get yelled at by the borrow checker if they try to hold borrows
of arguments across yields. But the fix is generally easy: move the argument
to a new binding before yielding.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Magic mutation could be replaced by &quot;magic shadowing&quot; where new arguments
shadow old ones at yield in order to allow easy borrowing of past argument
values. But this is a huge footgun. See if you can spot the issue with the
following code if <code>ctx</code> shadows its past value rather than overwriting it:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">std::future::from_fn(|ctx| {
  if is_blocked() {
    register_waker(ctx);
    yield Pending;
  }

  while let Pending = task.poll(ctx) { .. }
})
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Yield expression&quot; causes problems with first-resume input.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a> passes the first resume argument via a closure parameters
while later arguments are produced by <code>yield</code> expressions.</li>
<li>This part of why it is so hard to unify generalized coroutines with a
generator syntax like <code>gen { }</code> or <code>gen fn</code>. Where does the first input go?
Where do you annotate the argument type even?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To increase clarity, users almost always want resume arguments to be named.
<ul>
<li>With magic mutation, all resume arguments are already named since they reuse
the closures arguments on every resume. Any unmoved arguments are dropped
just prior to yielding, so they are not witnessed and do not increase the
coroutine size.
<ul>
<li>Also get multiple arguments for free if using the <code>Fn*</code> traits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yield expressions require users to repeatedly assign resume arguments to
named bindings manually. Such bindings must be included in the closure state
if they have any drop logic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="borrowed-resume-arguments"><a class="header" href="#borrowed-resume-arguments">Borrowed resume arguments</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>What happens when a coroutine witnesses a borrow passed as a resume argument?
For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let co = |x: &amp;i32| {
  let mut values = Vec::new();
  loop {
    values.push(x);
    yield;
  }
};

// potentially ok:
let mut x = 0;
co(&amp;x);

// must not be allowed:
x = 1;
co(&amp;x);
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>As of writing, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2781">RFC-2781</a> leaves this as an unresolved question with a note
to potentially restrict resume arguments to being <code>'static</code>.</li>
<li>Since coroutines under <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2781">MCP-49</a> act as much like closures as possible, and
treat the witness and capture data the same whenever possible, the example
above would fail in a similar way to the example below, giving a &quot;borrowed
data escapes into closure state&quot; error or similar even if <code>x</code> is not mutated.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut values = Vec::new();
|x: &amp;i32| {
  loop {
    values.push(x);
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `x` escapes the closure body here
    yield;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>As of writing, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a> appears to take a similar approach (although the
error message is not super descriptive).</li>
<li>Ideally someday we'd do something nicer but any such solution would apply to both captured state and witnessed state in the same way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lending"><a class="header" href="#lending">Lending</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Coroutines would eventually like to yield borrows of state to the caller. This
is &quot;lending&quot; coroutine (sometimes also called an &quot;attached&quot; coroutine).</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a>, a lending coroutine might look like:</li>
</ul>

  let mut buffer = Vec::new();
  loop {
    let n = fill_buffer(&amp;mut buffer);
    yield &amp;buffer[..n];
  }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>None of the major proposals have made an effort to resolve this directly as
far as I am aware.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2996/">RFC-2996</a> gets the closest with a mention of <code>LendingStream</code> and
<code>LendingIterator</code> traits in &quot;future additions&quot;.</li>
<li>We should probably get some experience with lending traits at the lib level
before attempting to add language level support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If lending closures were implemented, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a> could immediately be used to
build lending streams, iterators, etc so long as the respective traits have
the needed GAT-ification.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enum-wrapping"><a class="header" href="#enum-wrapping">Enum-wrapping</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2781">RFC-2781</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a> propose that <code>yield x</code> should produce
<code>GeneratorState::Yielded(x)</code> or equivalent as an output, in order to
discriminate between yielded and returned values.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a> instead gives <code>yield x</code> and <code>return x</code> nearly identical semantics
and output <code>x</code> directly, so the two must return the same type.</li>
<li>Enum-wrapping here is analogous to Ok-wrapping elsewhere. Similar debates
result.</li>
<li>When using enum-wrapping, the syntax to specify distinct return/yield types is
hotly debated.</li>
<li>Generators always want return and yield to have different types (<code>()</code> vs <code>T</code>)
but a generator syntax on top of coroutines could be used to auto-insert enum
wrappers around yield vs return arguments.</li>
<li>Auto-enum-wrapping can slightly improve type safety in some cases where
<code>return</code> should be treated specially to avoid bugs.</li>
<li>No-enum-wrapping when combined with the <code>impl Fn*</code> choice of trait, allow
the coroutine syntax to be used directly with existing higher-order methods
on iterator, stream, collection types, async traits, etc.</li>
<li>Note these two approaches are &quot;isomorphic&quot;: a coroutine that returns
<code>GeneratorState&lt;T, T&gt;</code> could be wrapped to return <code>T</code> by some sort of
combinator and a coroutine that only returns <code>T</code> can have <code>yield</code> and <code>return</code>
values manually wrapped in <code>GeneratorState</code>. This is just about ergonomics:</li>

<h2 id="movability"><a class="header" href="#movability">Movability</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All proposals want movability/<code>impl Unpin</code> to be inferred.
<ul>
<li>If we forbid &quot;borrowed data escaping into closure state&quot;, the inference
rules should be relatively simple: witnessing any borrow triggers
immovability.
<ul>
<li>Dead borrows should not be witnessed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But exact inference rules may only be well understood after an attempt at
implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Soundness of <code>pin_mut!</code> is a little tricky but seems to be fine no matter what.
<ul>
<li>If the resulting mutable borrow is witnessed ⇒ coroutine is <code>!Unpin</code> because
of inference rules</li>
<li>If the pinned data is <code>!Unpin</code> and is witnessed ⇒ coroutine is <code>!Unpin</code>
because witness contains <code>!Unpin</code> data</li>
<li>Thus, if the coroutine can be moved after resume, any data stack-pinned
(really witness-pinned) by <code>pin_mut!</code> is not referenced and is <code>Unpin</code>.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2781">RFC-2781</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033">eRFC-2033</a> propose that all coroutines become poisoned
after returning.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a> recommends that all non-capture-destroying coroutines resume at
their initial state after returning.
<ul>
<li>This can be very handy in some situations. In fact, I use it several times
in examples to increase readability. See anywhere I <code>iter.map(coroutine)</code> or
the base64 encoder.</li>
<li>Similar question around generators: should they loop to save on a state or
should they be fused-by-default?</li>
<li>If we do decide to panic-after-return, restart-after-return can still be
emulated using <code>loop { .. }</code> as the coroutine body instead of simply <code>{ .. }</code>. This is even zero-cost because unreachable poison states are eliminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a> also optionally proposes that capture-destroying closures should
only implement <code>FnOnce</code> unless explicitly annotated, even if they should
apparently be resumable several times.
<ul>
<li><code>mut || { drop(capture); }</code> is recommended as the modifier, to hint that an
<code>FnMut</code> impl is being requested when the closure in question would otherwise
impl only <code>FnOnce</code>.</li>
<li>But the behavior of this modifier is probably too obscure and requires
too much explanation vs &quot;closures always impl FnMut/FnPin if they contain
yield&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="async-coroutines"><a class="header" href="#async-coroutines">Async coroutines</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>I am aware of no strong proposal for an async version of generalized
coroutines although a fair amount of discussion has taken place.
<ul>
<li>In the context of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a>, how should <code>async || { ... yield ...}</code> be
handled in the very long-term? <em>Error right now.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Async coroutines don't make much sense because of resume arguments. Async
functions are already coroutines which take an <code>&amp;mut Context</code> as a resume
argument. How should additional arguments should be specified?
<ul>
<li>Do the additional args need to be passed every single poll or are they only
needed when resuming after <code>Ready</code>?</li>
<li>If they are stored between <code>Ready</code>s, how does that interact with the ban on
witnessing external borrows? Badly.</li>
<li>On resume, the the coroutine might only take the additional arguments. It
could then yield a future to take the async context and handle any <code>Pending</code>
yields.</li>
<li>If so, how is the coroutine body broken up into distinct futures to be
yielded?</li>
<li>What happens if a yielded future is destroyed early? Panic on resume?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generators and async are both sugars on top of coroutines and are orthogonal
to each other. But neither is orthogonal to the underlying coroutine feature:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// an async block
async {
  &quot;hello&quot;
}

// an async generator
async gen {
  yield &quot;hello&quot;;
}

// an &quot;async coroutine&quot;
|ctx: &amp;mut Context| {
  yield Poll::Ready(&quot;hello&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Taking the async context explicitly makes it cleaner to implement some complex
async functions which take additional poll parameters.
<ul>
<li>An <code>await_with!</code> macro would be quite useful for implementing <code>await</code> loops
on arbitrary <code>Poll</code>-returning functions.
<ul>
<li>Would be a good candidate for an <code>.await(args..)</code> syntax if very heavily
used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, an simple little checksumming async write wrapper might look
like this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">|ctx: &amp;mut Context, bytes: &amp;[u8]| -&gt; Poll&lt;usize&gt; {
  let mut checksum = 0;
  let mut count = 0;
  pin_mut!(writer);

  loop {
    let n = 4096 - count;
    if n == 0 {
      await_with!(writer.poll_write, ctx, &amp;[checksum]);
    }

    let part = &amp;bytes[..bytes.len().min(n)];
    checksum = part.fold(checksum, |x, &amp;y| x ^ y);
    await_with!(writer.poll_write, ctx, part);

    count += part.len();
    yield Ready(part.len());
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="try"><a class="header" href="#try">Try</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All proposals work fine with the <code>?</code> operator without even trying (haha).</li>
<li><code>Poll&lt;Result&lt;_, _&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>Poll&lt;Option&lt;Result&lt;_, _&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> already implement <code>Try</code>!</li>
<li>Generators usually want a totally different <code>?</code> desugar that does <code>yield Some(Err(...)); return None;</code> instead of <code>return Err(...)</code>.
<ul>
<li>This comes up a lot in discussions of general coroutine syntaxes but just
muddies things up because (say it with me) generators ≠ coroutines.</li>
<li>Sugar-free implementation is easy: <code>yield Some(try { ... }); None</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try blocks in general are super useful for handing errors by moving into
specific error-handeling states.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="language-similarity"><a class="header" href="#language-similarity">Language similarity</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Rust's version of coroutines can be a bit unusual compared to other languages.
But the reason for this is simple: you need arguments to resume Rusty
coroutines.</li>
<li>Resume arguments in other languages can be passed just fine by sharing mutable
data. So all they need to implement are generators, not true coroutines as
defined here.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Generator function takes a word list and name on construction.
# The shared list is mutated to make room for new words.
def write_greeting(name, words):
    words.append('hello')
    if words.is_full:
        yield
    words.append(name)

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Function only needs name to construct coroutine.
// Coroutine gets mutable access to the word list each resume.
fn write_greeting(name: String) -&gt; impl FnMut(&amp;mut Vec&lt;String&gt;) {
  |words| {
    words.push(&quot;hello&quot;.to_string());
    if words.len() == words.capacity() {
      yield
    }
    words.push(name);
  }
}

<h2 id="language-complexity"><a class="header" href="#language-complexity">Language complexity</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The main selling point of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a> is that it avoids adding a whole new language feature with associated design questions. Instead, the common answer to questions regarding MCP-49 is that yield-closures simply do whatever closures do.
<ul>
<li>The syntax is the same.</li>
<li>Captures work the same way.</li>
<li>Arguments are passed the same way.</li>
<li>Return and yield both drop the latest arguments and then pop the call stack.</li>
<li>The only big difference is that once <code>yield</code> is involved, some variables get
stored in a witness struct rather than in the stack frame. Plus the need for
a poison state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In fact, <code>return</code> behaves exactly like a simultaneous <code>yield</code> + <code>break 'closure_body</code>.
<ul>
<li>In a sense, every closure already has a single yield point at which it
resumes after <code>return</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>yield</code> adds a second resume point: hence the need for a discriminant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under that proposal, anywhere a closure can be used, a coroutine can too. And
vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="generator-unification"><a class="header" href="#generator-unification">Generator unification</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>So far in this proposal, I've been very careful to distinguish generators (as
supported by the propane and async_stream crates, proposed by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2996/">RFC-2996</a>,
etc) from the coroutines discussed here. They are treated as two separate
language features.</li>
<li>Does Rust have &quot;room&quot; for both stream syntax and a generator syntax? Would it
be better to find a single solution to both?</li>
<li>A single solution is difficult for a few reasons:
<ul>
<li>Taking resume arguments muddies the syntax. For example, what would be the
syntax for a generator function which takes an explicit resume argument?</li>
<li>The closure syntax works great for coroutines which implement <code>Fn*</code> a la
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/49">MCP-49</a>! But reusing that syntax to magically implement <code>Iterator</code> or
<code>Stream</code> would cause confusion.</li>
<li>On that note, generators <em>definitely</em> want to implement different traits vs
coroutines. <code>Iterator</code> and <code>Stream</code> rather than <code>Fn</code> or (ironically)
<code>Generator</code>.</li>
<li>As stated above, async coroutines don't make much sense: async interacts
poorly with resume arguments.</li>
<li>Async generators are super important, don't care about resume arguments.</li>
<li>As mentioned in the section on try, generators and coroutines generally want
different error handling. Or at lest, some more complex <code>?</code> desugar is not
so obvious for coroutines in general as it is for generators specifically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once generalized coroutines are in place, a generator syntax like the one in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2996/">RFC-2996</a> is a trivial sugar on top:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">gen {
  for item in inner {
    for mapped in func(item) {
      yield mapped;
    }
  }
}

// becomes

std::iter::from_fn(|| {
  for item in inner {
    for mapped in func(item) {
      yield Some(mapped);
    }
  }
  None
})
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async gen {
  while let Some(item) = inner.next().await {
    yield func(item).await;
  }
}

// becomes

std::stream::from_fn(|ctx| {
  while let Some(item) = await_with!(inner.next(), ctx) {
    yield Ready(Some(await_with!(func(item), ctx)));
  }
  Ready(None)
})
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Proc-macro crates could provide very satisfactory <code>gen</code> and <code>gen_async</code> macros
until we are sure of the need to support such a sugar directly in language as
a keyword or in core as a first-party macro.</li>
</ul>
